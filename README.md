# COBOL Project

## Overview
This project is a COBOL-based application designed to demonstrate various functionalities related to business programming and data manipulation. COBOL is commonly used in enterprise systems, particularly for finance and administrative systems. The project may include functionalities such as file handling, data processing, and interactive transactions.

## Features
- **File Management**: Process and manage sequential, indexed, or relative files.
- **Data Processing**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on business data.
- **Interactive Transactions**: Enable user interaction via the COBOL program, allowing real-time data updates.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports based on processed data.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling during file read/write operations.

## Technologies
- **COBOL**: The core programming language used for this project.
- **GnuCOBOL**: Open-source COBOL compiler used to compile the COBOL programs.
- **Indexed/Sequential Files**: For data storage and access methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **GnuCOBOL**: [Install GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/)
- COBOL editor or IDE (optional): You can use a text editor like VS Code or an IDE like OpenCOBOLIDE.

File Handling
This project works with different file types:

Sequential Files: For sequential reading and writing.
Indexed Files: For random access to records based on key values.
Error Handling
Error handling is implemented to catch file-related issues such as missing files, end-of-file conditions, and invalid data formats.
